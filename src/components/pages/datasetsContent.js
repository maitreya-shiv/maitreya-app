    "output": "In a bustling kitchen of the future, Robot X-5 stood motionless, its optical sensors fixed on the sizzling pan before it. 'Crack two eggs,' the recipe instructed. With precision, X-5 selected an egg from the carton, but its metallic fingers crushed the delicate shell, sending yolk dripping down its chassis. Undeterred, X-5 tried again, this time adjusting its grip strength. Success! The egg cracked perfectly into the pan. As the day progressed, X-5 learned to chop vegetables without pulverizing them and to measure ingredients with increasing accuracy. By evening, a slightly lopsided but edible omelet sat on a plate, steam rising from its golden surface. X-5's LED display flickered in what could only be described as pride. It had taken its first step in mastering the art of cooking, proving that even robots can find joy in creating something delicious."

              Whereas supervised fine-tuning trains models on input examples and their corresponding outputs, instruction tuning augments input-output examples with instructions, 
              which enables instruction-tuned models to generalize more easily to new tasks.",
